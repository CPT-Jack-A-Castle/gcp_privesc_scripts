# gcp_privesc_scripts

Repo with (ugly) scripts that generate vulnerable environments to escalate privileges, exploit them and clean everything.

Execute them from an account with owner permissions over the project where the environments are going to be generated.

CREATE A PROJECT SPECIFICALLY TO EXECUTE THESE SCRIPTS AND DELETE THE PROJECT WHEN YOU ARE FINISH.
